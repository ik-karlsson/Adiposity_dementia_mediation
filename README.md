While midlife adiposity is a risk factor for dementia, adiposity in late-life appears to be associated with lower risk. What drives the associations is poorly understood, especially the inverse association in late-life. To identify and examine potential mediating facctors in the association, we took an empirical approach, using results from genome-wide association studies to identify biological pathways shared between adiposity and dementia. This method highlighted inflammation and lipid metabolism as shared pathways, and thus potential mediators of the associatin between adiposity and dementia. These steps are desscribed in the folder "FUMA_shared_pathways".

To examine if these factors mediate the effect of midlife and/or late-life adiposity on dementia, we then used data from the Swedish Twin Registry, with measures of adiposity and potential mediators taken in midlife (age 40-64, n=5999) or late-life (age 65-90, n=7257). Associations between body-mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), C-reactive protein (CRP), lipid levels, and dementia risk were tested in survival and mediation analyses. This demonstrated that one standard deviation (SD) higher WHR in midlife was associated with 25% (95% CI 2-52%) higher dementia risk, with slight attenuation when adjusting for BMI. No evidence of mediation through CRP or lipid levels was present. After age 65, one SD higher BMI, but not WHR, was associated with 8% (95% CI 1-14%) lower dementia risk. The association was partly mediated by higher CRP and suppressed by lower high-density lipoprotein. This indicates that the negative effects of midlife adiposity on dementia risk were driven directly by factors associated with body fat distribution, and not mediated by inflammation or lipid levels. In contrast, there was an inverse association between late-life BMI and dementia risk, especially where the bodyâ€™s inflammatory response and lipid homeostasis is intact. These analyses are described in the folder "Individual-level analyses".
